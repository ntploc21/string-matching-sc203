# String Matching Survey (SC203)

# Introduction

String comparison algorithms form the backbone of computer science, finding applications in text processing, pattern matching, and data mining. Our survey aims to unravel the performance nuances of these popular algorithms while offering practical code implementations.

# Algorithm

- Rabin-Karp
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP)
- Boyer-Moore
- Suffix Tree
- Aho-Corasick

# Installation

Each algorithm implementation is included in its designated folder. To run or test a specific algorithm, go to each folder and read README.md on each algorithm for more details.

# Exploration Resources
